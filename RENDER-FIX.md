# 🚨 URGENT: Fix "vite permission denied" Error

## The Problem
You're getting "vite permission denied" because you're deploying as a **Web Service** instead of a **Static Site**.

## ✅ EXACT SOLUTION (Copy-Paste Steps):

### Step 1: Delete Current Service
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Find your current "smartguard" service
3. Click on it
4. Go to "Settings" → "Delete Service"
5. Confirm deletion

### Step 2: Create NEW Static Site
1. Click "New +" → **"Static Site"** (NOT Web Service!)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Use these EXACT settings:

```
Name: smartguard
Branch: main
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
Publish Directory: dist
Node Version: 18
```

### Step 3: Deploy
1. Click "Create Static Site"
2. Wait for deployment to complete

## 🔍 Why This Happens:

- **Web Service** = Expects a running Node.js server (like Express.js)
- **Static Site** = Just serves your pre-built `dist/` folder
- **Vite builds** = Creates static files that just need to be served

## 📋 Alternative: Manual Configuration

If you want to configure manually without render.yaml:

1. **Delete** your current service
2. **Create Static Site**
3. **Don't use render.yaml** - configure manually:
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`
   - Node Version: `18`

## 🚨 Common Mistakes:
- ❌ Creating a "Web Service" instead of "Static Site"
- ❌ Using `npm start` as build command
- ❌ Setting wrong publish directory
- ❌ Not deleting the old Web Service first

## ✅ What Should Happen:
- Build completes successfully
- No permission errors
- Your React app loads correctly
- All routes work (thanks to SPA routing)

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?
If you're still getting errors:
1. Make sure you deleted the OLD service completely
2. Double-check you selected "Static Site" not "Web Service"
3. Use the exact build command: `npm install && npm run build`
4. Set publish directory to: `dist`
